# Answer from The ADR #

This projects original name was Pandoid.  It was the first thing that I thought of when starting it.  The first "public" release was called that.  This release was actually just the first version of the code that was able to play music from Pandora, and only distributed to a couple friends.  One of those friends suggested changing the name to "Pandoroid" because it sounded and looked more like "Droid" (both of our phones of choice) and I agreed.  I changed all user-facing strings to be Pandoroid but felt that Pandoid was easier and more preferable to use internally, and so I left it like that.

And that's all there is to it.
